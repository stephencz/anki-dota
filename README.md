generally not worth the effort. 

## FAQ

**Q:** How accurate is this deck?

All cards in this deck are created using data from this [Dota 2 Wiki](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Dota_2_Wiki). Therefore, the cards are as accurate as the Wiki.

**Q:** How up-to-date is this deck?

I try to release an updated version of the deck with every major release. Collecting the data the deck uses is a time consuming process. And organizing the resulting
csv files into a single, coherent deck of cards, also takes some time. Therefore, I don't update the deck when there are minor updates. I don't believe this is an issue 
as the use of the deck is more in gaining a general understanding of the game's items and heroes. Small changes to values generally won't matter if you understand the
gist of what an item or hero does.
