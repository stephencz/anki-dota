Dota 2 is an exceptionally hard game to learn. There are over two hundred unique items, over one hundred unique heros, and nuanced game mechanics. To make learning the game easier for myself, I created this Anki Deck. 

## FAQ

**Q:** How accurate are the flashcards?

All data used in the flashcards is pulled directly from the [Dota 2 Fandom Wiki](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Dota_2_Wiki). Accordingly, the flashcards will be as accurate as the Wiki. I plan on releasing an updated deck with every major update.

## To Do

* ~~Implement item data scraping~~
* Implement hero data scraping
* Implement item card and deck generation
* Implement hero card and deck generation
* Release the first deck.
